## Rizito's Model


We are using visual references for our robot. All the required photos are located in the [`v-photos`](https://github.com/csvprobotica/Rizitos_2025/tree/main/v-photos) folder.

These include:
- Front, back, top, and side views of the robot  
- Close-up of the gear-based system  
- Final Version 1 layout (no differential system)

This collection serves as the model documentation of our robot for the WRO Future Engineers Senior category.
